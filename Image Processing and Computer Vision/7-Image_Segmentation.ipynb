        "Image segmentation is the process of partitioning an image into multiple segments (sets of pixels), simplifying or changing the representation of an image into something more meaningful and easier to analyze. This tutorial covers fundamental techniques used in image segmentation, including thresholding, edge-based segmentation, region-based segmentation, clustering-based segmentation, and deep learning-based segmentation.\n",
