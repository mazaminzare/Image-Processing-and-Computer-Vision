        "# Morphological Operations: A Comprehensive Tutorial\n",
        "\n",
        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "Morphological operations are a set of image processing techniques that process images based on shapes. They apply a structuring element to an input image, creating an output image of the same size. Morphological operations are particularly useful for tasks such as noise removal, image enhancement, and object segmentation. This tutorial covers fundamental morphological operations including erosion, dilation, opening, closing, and hit-or-miss transformation.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 1. Erosion\n",
        "\n",
        "Erosion reduces the boundaries of the foreground (bright) regions. It removes pixels on object boundaries, making objects smaller.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1.1 Erosion Formula\n",
        "\n",
        "Given a binary image $I$ and a structuring element $B$, erosion is defined as:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "I \\ominus B = \\{z | (B)_z \\subseteq I\\}\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "where $(B)_z$ is the translation of $B$ by the vector $z$.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1.2 Advantages and Disadvantages\n",
        "\n",
        "**Advantages:**\n",
        "- Removes small noise and detach connected objects.\n",
        "- Useful for separating touching objects in an image.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Disadvantages:**\n",
        "- Can overly reduce object size, removing important details.\n",
        "- Sensitive to the shape and size of the structuring element.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. Dilation\n",
        "\n",
        "Dilation adds pixels to the boundaries of the foreground regions. It increases the size of objects, filling in small holes and connecting nearby objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2.1 Dilation Formula\n",
        "\n",
        "Given a binary image $I$ and a structuring element $B$, dilation is defined as:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "I \\oplus B = \\{z | (B^*)_z \\cap I \\neq \\emptyset\\}\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "where $B^*$ is the reflection of $B$.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2.2 Advantages and Disadvantages\n",
        "\n",
        "**Advantages:**\n",
        "- Fills in small holes and gaps in objects.\n",
        "- Connects nearby objects, making them easier to identify.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Disadvantages:**\n",
        "- Can overly enlarge objects, merging separate objects.\n",
        "- Sensitive to the shape and size of the structuring element.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 3. Opening\n",
        "\n",
        "Opening is an erosion followed by a dilation. It is useful for removing small objects and noise from an image while preserving the shape and size of larger objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3.1 Opening Formula\n",
        "\n",
        "Given a binary image $I$ and a structuring element $B$, opening is defined as:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "I \\circ B = (I \\ominus B) \\oplus B\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3.2 Advantages and Disadvantages\n",

        "**Advantages:**\n",
        "- Removes small noise and detach small objects.\n",
        "- Preserves the shape and size of larger objects.\n",
        "\n",

        "- Can remove important small details.\n",
        "- Sensitive to the shape and size of the structuring element.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 4. Closing\n",
        "\n",
        "Closing is a dilation followed by an erosion. It is useful for filling small holes and gaps in objects while preserving the shape and size of larger objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4.1 Closing Formula\n",
        "\n",
        "Given a binary image $I$ and a structuring element $B$, closing is defined as:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "I \\bullet B = (I \\oplus B) \\ominus B\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4.2 Advantages and Disadvantages\n",
        "\n",
        "**Advantages:**\n",
        "- Fills in small holes and gaps in objects.\n",
        "- Preserves the shape and size of larger objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Disadvantages:**\n",
        "- Can merge nearby objects, making them indistinguishable.\n",
        "- Sensitive to the shape and size of the structuring element.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 5. Hit-or-Miss Transformation\n",
        "\n",
        "Hit-or-miss transformation detects a specific pattern in the image using a composite structuring element.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5.1 Hit-or-Miss Formula\n",
        "\n",
        "Given a binary image $I$ and structuring elements $B_1$ and $B_2$, the hit-or-miss transformation is defined as:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "I \\otimes (B_1, B_2) = (I \\ominus B_1) \\cap (I^c \\ominus B_2)\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "where $I^c$ is the complement of $I$.\n",
