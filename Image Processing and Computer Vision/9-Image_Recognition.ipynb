        "\n",
        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "Image recognition involves identifying objects, patterns, or features within an image. It is a critical task in computer vision, enabling applications such as facial recognition, object detection, and scene understanding. This tutorial covers fundamental image recognition techniques, including template matching, feature-based methods, and deep learning-based methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 1. Template Matching\n",
        "\n",
        "Template matching is a technique for finding small parts of an image that match a template image. It involves sliding the template over the input image and computing similarity measures at each position.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1.1 Template Matching Formula\n",
        "\n",
        "Given an image $I(x, y)$ and a template $T(x, y)$, the matching score at position $(i, j)$ can be computed using normalized cross-correlation (NCC):\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "R(i, j) = \\frac{\\sum_{x, y} \\left[ I(i+x, j+y) - \\bar{I}_{ij} \\right] \\left[ T(x, y) - \\bar{T} \\right]}{\\sqrt{\\sum_{x, y} \\left[ I(i+x, j+y) - \\bar{I}_{ij} \\right]^2 \\sum_{x, y} \\left[ T(x, y) - \\bar{T} \\right]^2}}\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "where $\\bar{I}_{ij}$ and $\\bar{T}$ are the mean values of the image patch and the template, respectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1.2 Advantages and Disadvantages\n",
        "\n",
        "**Advantages:**\n",
        "- Simple and easy to implement.\n",
        "- Effective for images with little variation in scale, rotation, and illumination.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Disadvantages:**\n",
        "- Sensitive to changes in scale, rotation, and illumination.\n",
        "- Computationally expensive for large images and templates.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. Feature-Based Methods\n",
        "\n",
        "Feature-based methods detect and describe local features in images, which can then be used for matching and recognition. Common feature-based methods include SIFT, SURF, and ORB.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2.1 SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform)\n",
        "\n",
        "SIFT identifies and describes local features that are invariant to scale, rotation, and partially invariant to illumination changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2.1.1 SIFT Algorithm\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Scale-space Extrema Detection:** Detect key points by searching for local extrema in the scale-space, which is constructed using the Difference of Gaussians (DoG).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Keypoint Localization:** Refine the detected key points by fitting a 3D quadratic function to the local sample points to determine the location, scale, and contrast.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Orientation Assignment:** Assign an orientation to each key point based on the local image gradient direction.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Keypoint Descriptor:** Generate a descriptor for each key point by computing the gradient magnitude and orientation at each region around the key point and storing the values in a 128-dimensional vector.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2.2 Advantages and Disadvantages\n",
        "\n",
