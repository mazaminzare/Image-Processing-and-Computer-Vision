        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "Geometric transformations involve the manipulation of an image to correct distortions or to perform operations such as rotation, scaling, translation, and shearing. These transformations are fundamental in various applications such as image registration, object recognition, and image stitching.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 1. Translation\n",
        "\n",
        "Translation moves an image from one location to another within the coordinate system. It is described by shifting each pixel of the image by a certain offset.\n",

        "### 1.1 Translation Formula\n",
        "\n",
        "The translation transformation can be represented as:\n",
