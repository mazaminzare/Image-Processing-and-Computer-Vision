        "# Instance Segmentation: A Comprehensive Tutorial\n",
        "\n",
        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "Instance segmentation is a computer vision task that involves detecting and delineating each object instance in an image. Unlike semantic segmentation, which assigns a class label to each pixel, instance segmentation differentiates between different objects of the same class. This tutorial covers fundamental instance segmentation techniques, including traditional methods and deep learning-based methods like Mask R-CNN.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 1. Traditional Methods\n",
        "\n",
        "Traditional methods for instance segmentation often involve region proposal methods and clustering techniques. These methods, however, have largely been superseded by deep learning approaches due to their limited accuracy and scalability.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. Deep Learning-Based Methods\n",
        "\n",
        "Deep learning-based methods, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have significantly advanced the field of instance segmentation. One of the most popular and successful methods is Mask R-CNN.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2.1 Mask R-CNN\n",
        "\n",
        "Mask R-CNN extends Faster R-CNN by adding a branch for predicting segmentation masks on each Region of Interest (RoI), in parallel with the existing branches for classification and bounding box regression.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2.1.1 Mask R-CNN Architecture\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Backbone Network:** Extracts feature maps from the input image using a CNN (e.g., ResNet).\n",
        "2. **Region Proposal Network (RPN):** Generates region proposals from the feature maps.\n",
        "3. **RoI Align:** Aligns the regions of interest to the feature maps to ensure accurate spatial locations.\n",
        "4. **Bounding Box Regression and Classification:** Refines the bounding box coordinates and classifies each RoI.\n",
        "5. **Segmentation Mask:** Predicts a binary mask for each RoI.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2.1.2 Mathematical Formulation\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Backbone Network\n",
        "\n",
        "Let \\( I \\) be the input image. The backbone network extracts feature maps \\( F \\) from \\( I \\):\n",

        "#### RoI Align\n",
        "\n",
        "RoI Align ensures that the regions of interest are accurately aligned with the feature maps. Given a region proposal \\( R_i \\), RoI Align extracts the corresponding feature map \\( F_{R_i} \\):\n",
        "\n",

        "F_{R_i} = \\text{RoIAlign}(F, R_i)\n",

        "#### Bounding Box Regression and Classification\n",
        "\n",
        "For each aligned region \\( F_{R_i} \\), the network predicts the class probabilities \\( p_i \\) and refines the bounding box coordinates \\( b_i \\):\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "p_i, b_i = \\text{Classifier}(F_{R_i})\n",

        "\n",
        "In parallel with the classification and bounding box regression, the network predicts a binary mask \\( M_i \\) for each region \\( R_i \\):\n",

        "The overall loss function for Mask R-CNN combines the losses from classification, bounding box regression, and mask prediction:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "L = L_{\\text{cls}} + L_{\\text{bbox}} + L_{\\text{mask}}\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",

        "- \\( L_{\\text{cls}} \\) is the classification loss, typically cross-entropy loss.\n",
        "- \\( L_{\\text{bbox}} \\) is the bounding box regression loss, typically smooth L1 loss.\n",
        "- \\( L_{\\text{mask}} \\) is the mask prediction loss, typically binary cross-entropy loss.\n",
