        "# Image Restoration: A Comprehensive Tutorial\n",
        "\n",
        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "Image restoration involves improving the appearance of an image by reducing or removing degradations that have occurred during the image acquisition process. These degradations may include noise, blur, or distortions. This tutorial covers fundamental image restoration techniques, including noise reduction, deblurring, and inverse filtering, along with their advantages and disadvantages.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 1. Noise Reduction\n",
        "\n",
        "Noise reduction techniques aim to remove noise from an image while preserving its important features. Common types of noise include Gaussian noise, salt-and-pepper noise, and speckle noise.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1.1 Mean Filter\n",
        "\n",
        "The mean filter smooths an image by averaging the pixel values within a local neighborhood.\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "g(x, y) = \\frac{1}{mn} \\sum_{s=-a}^{a} \\sum_{t=-b}^{b} f(x+s, y+t)\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "where $m \\times n$ is the size of the filter, and $a = \\frac{m-1}{2}$, $b = \\frac{n-1}{2}$.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1.2 Median Filter\n",
        "\n",
        "The median filter replaces each pixel value with the median value of the intensities in the neighborhood.\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "g(x, y) = \\text{median} \\{ f(x+i, y+j) | (i, j) \\in W \\}\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "where $W$ is the neighborhood window.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1.3 Advantages and Disadvantages\n",
        "\n",
        "**Advantages:**\n",
        "- Mean Filter: Simple and easy to implement.\n",
        "- Median Filter: Effective at reducing salt-and-pepper noise while preserving edges.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Disadvantages:**\n",
        "- Mean Filter: Blurs edges and fine details.\n",
        "- Median Filter: Computationally more expensive than the mean filter.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. Deblurring\n",
        "\n",
        "Deblurring techniques aim to recover a sharp image from a blurred one. Blur can be caused by factors such as camera motion, defocus, or atmospheric conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2.1 Motion Blur\n",
        "\n",
        "Motion blur occurs when there is relative motion between the camera and the scene during exposure. It can be modeled as a convolution of the original image with a linear motion kernel.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2.2 Deblurring with Wiener Filter\n",
        "\n",
        "The Wiener filter is a linear filter that aims to minimize the mean square error between the estimated and the true images. It is given by:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "G(u, v) = \\frac{H^*(u, v) |F(u, v)|^2}{|H(u, v)|^2 |F(u, v)|^2 + K}\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "where $G(u, v)$ is the restored image, $H(u, v)$ is the degradation function, $F(u, v)$ is the degraded image, and $K$ is a constant that controls the trade-off between noise reduction and image sharpness.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2.3 Advantages and Disadvantages\n",
        "\n",
        "**Advantages:**\n",
        "- Effective for images with known blur kernels.\n",
        "- Can reduce noise while deblurring.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Disadvantages:**\n",
        "- Requires knowledge of the blur kernel.\n",
        "- May not perform well on complex blur patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 3. Inverse Filtering\n",
        "\n",
        "Inverse filtering aims to recover the original image by applying the inverse of the degradation function to the degraded image.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3.1 Inverse Filter Formula\n",
        "\n",
        "Given a degraded image $G(u, v)$ and a degradation function $H(u, v)$, the restored image $F(u, v)$ is obtained by:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "F(u, v) = \\frac{G(u, v)}{H(u, v)}\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3.2 Advantages and Disadvantages\n",
        "\n",
        "**Advantages:**\n",
        "- Simple and direct method for deblurring.\n",
        "- Effective when the degradation function is well-known and noise-free.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Disadvantages:**\n",
        "- Highly sensitive to noise.\n",
        "- Amplifies high-frequency noise if $H(u, v)$ has small values.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 4. Total Variation (TV) Denoising\n",
        "\n",
        "Total variation denoising is a technique that reduces noise while preserving edges by minimizing the total variation of the image.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4.1 TV Denoising Formula\n",
        "\n",
        "The TV denoising problem can be formulated as:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\\min_u \\left( \\|u - f\\|_2^2 + \\lambda \\|\\nabla u\\|_1 \\right)\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "where $f$ is the noisy image, $u$ is the denoised image, $\\nabla u$ is the gradient of $u$, and $\\lambda$ is a regularization parameter that controls the trade-off between noise reduction and edge preservation.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4.2 Advantages and Disadvantages\n",
        "\n",
        "**Advantages:**\n",
        "- Preserves edges while reducing noise.\n",
        "- Effective for various types of noise.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Disadvantages:**\n",
        "- Computationally intensive.\n",
        "- Requires careful selection of the regularization parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "Image restoration techniques are crucial for improving the quality of images affected by noise, blur, and other degradations. This tutorial covered various methods including noise reduction (mean and median filters), deblurring (Wiener filter), inverse filtering, and total variation denoising, along with their advantages and disadvantages. Each method has its own applications, depending on the specific requirements of the task at hand.\n"
