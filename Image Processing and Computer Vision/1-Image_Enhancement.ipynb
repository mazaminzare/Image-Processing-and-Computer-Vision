        "\n",
        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "Image enhancement involves improving the visual appearance of an image or converting the image to a form better suited for analysis by a human or machine. This tutorial covers the fundamental techniques used in image enhancement, including both spatial domain and frequency domain methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 1. Histogram Equalization\n",
        "\n",
        "Histogram equalization is a method in image processing of contrast adjustment using the image's histogram. It improves the contrast of an image by stretching out the range of intensity values.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1.1 Histogram Equalization Formula\n",
        "\n",
        "Given an image $I$, we can define the normalized histogram as:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "p(i) = \\frac{h(i)}{n \\cdot m}\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "where $h(i)$ is the histogram of the image, and $n \\cdot m$ is the total number of pixels.\n",
        "\n",
        "The cumulative distribution function (CDF) is:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\\text{CDF}(i) = \\sum_{j=0}^{i} p(j)\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "The histogram equalized value is then given by:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "I_{eq}(i) = \\text{round}((\\text{CDF}(i) - \\text{CDF}_{\\min}) \\times \\frac{L-1}{n \\cdot m})\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "where $L$ is the number of possible intensity levels (usually 256 for 8-bit images).\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1.2 Advantages and Disadvantages\n",

        "- Can enhance noise along with the signal.\n",
        "- May not be suitable for images with a wide dynamic range.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. Spatial Filtering\n",

        "- Preserves edges better than linear smoothing filters.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Disadvantages:**\n",
        "- Computationally more expensive than linear filters.\n",
        "- Not as effective for Gaussian noise.\n",
        "\n",
